Run application (.NET 5 WEB API) in Visual Studio (2019) and connect with postman to defined host (http://localhost:5000).

Please use prepared postman collection from https://www.getpostman.com/collections/44dc3e16224549072a1a (for proper input structure).
*The structure of the input is not exact to specifications, but the concept is the same; for exact specifications wrapper can be made, but it brings no additional insight.*

For visualisation purposes a simple HTML (index.html) has been added; connects to WEB API and populates relevant HTML elements.
